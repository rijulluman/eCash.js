This is a cryptocurrency based on a combination of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.
The main objective of this project was for me to learn the inner workings of cryptocurrencies(especially Bitcoin)
It took around 40 hours to develop this project.

I have used MongoDB to store the blockchain, Redis to store Unconfirmed Transactions and user wallet details.

This project covers the following features:
1. Create a new Public/Private Key pair (Wallet address)
2. Check any wallets balance (using public key)
3. Send and receive coins (Via Wallet Node)
4. Miner Software
5. Ability to update the blockchain, and manage forks in the blockchain

Demo Presentation of this Project available here: https://youtu.be/WS4KbFY5Zwo
Clear version of the video used in the Demo Presentation: https://youtu.be/tzT791uWvkE

(Sorry for the inconvenience, I am bad at video editing, hence was unable to merge the 2 videos into 1 view)

All the features are developed using Node.js. I am aware Node.js is not a good language for such a sensitive project, but due to time limitations I chose the language I am most comfortable with.(I had 2 other projects for my other courses and had only 4 weeks before my Finals to complete all these projects)

All the functionalities are available as API endpoints.

This project assumes that all connected network nodes are authenticated and trust-worthy. But in real-world scenarios this assumption makes this project completely unusable.
This project is not complete and has a lot of work remaining, but I have decided to stop working on it as it has a very limited future, also there may be exploits in the Chrome V8 engine that can be used to find serious loop-holes in my project.

I plan to develop a complete cryptocurrency as a part of my Graduate Project, if interested please check my profile again around December 2018.
